A toolbox for data grabbing and processing in python 3



Introduction
------------

**pybit** is a Python interface to the data collected by FitBit trackers. It uses
the FitBit website to download steps and sleep data with 5 minutes and 1 minute
intervals respectively. This software is still under development, and be aware
that if the FitBit website changes, this software will break. This software is
not using the documented API as it does not provide the intraday data, only
daily totals.
